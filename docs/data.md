# Working with Data

In {ref}`sqlatutorial:working-with-transactions`,
we learned the basics of how to interact with the Python DBAPI and its transactional state.
Then, in {ref}`sqlatutorial:working-with-metadata`,
we learned how to represent database
tables, columns, and constraints within SQLAlchemy using the {class}`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData` and related objects.
In this section we will combine both concepts above to create, select and manipulate data within a relational database.
Our interaction with the database is **always** in terms of a transaction,
even if we've set our database driver to use {ref}`autocommit <dbapi_autocommit>` behind the scenes.

The components of this section are as follows:

- {ref}`sqlatutorial:core-insert` - to get some data into the database,
  we introduce and demonstrate the Core {class}`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Insert` construct.
  INSERTs from an ORM perspective are described in the next section {ref}`sqlatutorial:orm-data-manipulation`.
- {ref}`sqlatutorial:selecting-data` - this section will describe in detail the {class}`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Select` construct,
  which is the most commonly used object in SQLAlchemy.
  The {class}`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Select` construct emits SELECT statements for both Core and ORM centric applications and both use cases will be described here.
  Additional ORM use cases are also noted in the later section {ref}`sqlatutorial:select-relationships` as well as the {ref}`queryguide_toplevel`.
- {ref}`sqlatutorial:core-update-delete` - Rounding out the INSERT and SELECTion
  of data, this section will describe from a Core perspective the use of the
  {class}`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Update` and {class}`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Delete` constructs.  ORM-specific UPDATE and DELETE is similarly described in the {ref}`sqlatutorial:orm-data-manipulation` section.
